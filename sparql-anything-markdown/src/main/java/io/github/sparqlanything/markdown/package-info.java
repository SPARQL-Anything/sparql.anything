@Format(name = "Markdown", description = "Markdown is a lightweight markup language for writing formatted documents inspired to conventions of web posting. We can interpret a Markdown document as a sequence of blocks (e.g. paragraphs, lists, headings, code blocks). Some blocks (e.g. list items) contain other blocks, whereas others contain inline contents (e.g. links, images etc.). In SPARQL Anything, a document is represented as a list of typed containers. Where the type denotes the kind of block (e.g. heading, paragraph, emphasised text, link, image etc.); lists are needed for specifying the sequence of the blocks. Additional attributes such as the depth of the header or the type of list (bullets, numbers, etc...) can be also supported, relying on the key-value structure.\n\nSPARQL Anything relies on the [CommonMark](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java) Java implementation of Commons Markdown.", resourceExample = "https://sparql-anything.cc/examples/simple.md")
