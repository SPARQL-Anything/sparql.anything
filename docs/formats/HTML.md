# HTML

HTML can be captured by the Document Object Model (DOM) specification.
HTML elements (also known as tags) can be considered containers.

According to the Facade-X model, SPARQL Anything uses:
- RDF Properties for specifying tag attributes;
- Container membership properties for specifying relations to child elements in the DOM tree.  These may include text, which can be expressed as RDF literals of type *xsd:string*.
- Tag names are used to type the container. Specifically, the tag name is used to mint a URI that identifies the class of the corresponding containers.

## Extensions

SPARQL Anything selects this transformer for the following file extensions:

- .html

## Media types

SPARQL Anything selects this transformer for the following media types:

- text/html

## Default implementation

- [io.github.sparqlanything.html.HTMLTriplifier](../sparql-anything-html/src/main/java/com/github/sparqlanything/html/HTMLTriplifier.java)

## Default Transformation

### Data

      <title>Hello world!</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      <p class="paragraph">Hello world</p>
   </body>
</html>
```


### Query

```
CONSTRUCT
